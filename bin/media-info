=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C media-info media-info

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

You can also install L<App::BashCompletionProg> which makes it easy to add completion for Perinci::CmdLine-based scripts. After you install the module and put C<. ~/.bash-complete-prog> (or C<. /etc/bash-complete-prog>), you can just run C<bash-completion-prog> and the C<complete> command will be added to your C<~/.bash-completion-prog>. Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete media-info 'p/*/`media-info`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

=head2 zsh

To activate zsh completion for this script, put:

 _media_info() { read -l; local cl="$REPLY"; read -ln; local cp="$REPLY"; reply=(`COMP_LINE="$cl" COMP_POINT="$cp" media-info`) }

 compctl -K _media_info media-info

in your zsh startup (e.g. C<~/.zshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.
