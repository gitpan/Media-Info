NAME
    Media::Info - Common interface for Media::Info::*

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use Media::Info qw(get_media_info);
     my $res = get_media_info(media => '/path/to/celine.mp4');

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a common interface for Media::Info::* modules,
    which you can use to get information about a media file (like video,
    music, etc) using specific backends. Currently the only backend
    available is Media::Info::Mplayer, so this module uses that.

SEE ALSO
    Video::Info - This module is first written because I couldn't install
    Video::Info. That module doesn't seem maintained (last release is in
    2003 at the time of this writing), plus I want a per-backend namespace
    organization instead of per-format one, and a simple functional
    interface instead of OO interface.
