VERSION
    This document describes version 0.07 of Media::Info (from Perl
    distribution Media-Info), released on 2014-11-28.

SYNOPSIS
     use Media::Info qw(get_media_info);
     my $res = get_media_info(media => '/path/to/celine.mp4');

    Sample result:

     [
       200,
       "OK",
       {

         audio_rate    => 44100,
         duration      => 2081.25,
         num_channels  => 2,
         num_chapters  => 0,

       },
     ]

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a common interface for Media::Info::* modules,
    which you can use to get information about a media file (like video,
    music, etc) using specific backends. Currently the only backend
    available is Media::Info::Mplayer, so this module uses that.

FUNCTIONS
  get_media_info(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Return information on media file/URL.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   media* => *str*

        Media file/URL.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

     (any)

SEE ALSO
    Video::Info - This module is first written because I couldn't install
    Video::Info. That module doesn't seem maintained (last release is in
    2003 at the time of this writing), plus I want a per-backend namespace
    organization instead of per-format one, and a simple functional
    interface instead of OO interface.
